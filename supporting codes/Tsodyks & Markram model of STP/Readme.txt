This folder contains the codes for generating the DBS-induced post-synaptic current (I_DBS) using the Tsodyks & Markram model (Tsodyks et al. (1998) and STAR Methods S3 in this paper). 

Users can replicate Figure S2 in this paper with the provided codes, trying the simulation with different 
frequencies of DBS.

The input data include:

1. FR_time_hist_conc.mat: The experimental firing rate computed by the time histogram method in Shimazaki et al. (2007) and Shimazaki et al. (2010). Data from all Vim-DBS frequencies {5,10,20,30,50,100,200Hz} are concatenated.

2. I_DBS_conc.mat: The DBS-induced post-synaptic current, obtained by the Tsodyks & Markram model (Tsodyks et al. (1998)). Data from all DBS frequencies {5,10,20,30,50,100,200Hz} are concatenated.

This folder contains the data and codes for generating results of the paper: "Uncovering network mechanism underlying thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation using a novel firing rate model". 

For details of each part, please see the Readme file in each folder.

1. The folder "experimental Vim data" contains the recorded Vim spike timings - and the corresponding binary spike trains - during different frequencies of Vim-DBS.

2. The folder "rate network model and route optimization" contains the information to generate 
the network model fit (Figure 2) with our route optimization method.

3. The folder "analysis with eigenpairs" contains the results related to the analysis with eigenvalues and   eigenvectors (related to Figure 4).

4. The folder "compare with spiking network model" contains the code simulating the spiking network model (STAR Methods S6 and Figure 7).

5. The folder "supporting codes" contains the codes related to our previous single-ensemble Vim model (Tian et al. (2023)), and STAR Methods S2 and S3.
